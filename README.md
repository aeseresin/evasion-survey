# Abstract
Today Mobile Malware analysis and detection systems are an essential part of the cyber security systems frontline. For that reason malware writers are widely using counter techniques in order to evade antivirus scanners and analysis processes.This thesis presents the malware evasion techniques while reviewing the malware detection and analysis methodologies and by matching the evasion techique with its corresponding counterpart. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that compiled all evasion techniques in a systematic way in the mobile domain. Moreover, we discuss the future trends on the malware evasion techniques.
