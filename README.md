# Abstract
In this thesis, we present the first methodical design of honeypot smart contracts on EOS blockchain platform. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to provide malicious contract detection in EOS platform and the first one using the Honeypot approach. Honeypot smart contracts are contracts that include vulnerabilities deliberately in their design along with trap routines. The idea is that the malicious contract is attracted by the manifested flaw and once he tries to exploit one of these apparent vulnerabilities trapdoor unfolds and the malicious actor unveils. HonEOS is a tool that employs vulnerabilities and associated trapdoors to expose the malicious contracts.
